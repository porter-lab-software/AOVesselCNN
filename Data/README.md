This folder contains the zipped data for the training and validation used when the code was developed. 
The zip files "Images01to17", "Images18to25" and "Imges28to31" are the grayscale images used for training. 
These files should be unzipped and put into a single folder named "Images" within the image_path defined in config_train.txt.

The TrainingGroundTruth.zip file contains the folder "combined" which provides the ground truth images that have 4 classes that correspond to the files for the Images folder for the training data set.

The zip files ValidationGroundTruth and ValidationImages contain the folders combined and images, respectively, required for validation.
