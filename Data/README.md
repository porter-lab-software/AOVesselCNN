This folder contains the zipped data for the training and validation used when the code was developed. 
The zip files "Images01to17", "Images18to25" and "Imges28to31" are the grayscale images used for training. 
These files should be unzipped and put into a single folder named "Images" within the image_path defined in config_train.txt
